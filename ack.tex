\chapter{Acknowledgments}

\noindent I am grateful to my supervisor, Reiner Kruecken, for his efforts in organizing this project, and ensuring that I would have the opportunity to carry out my thesis research at TRIUMF. \newline

\noindent Thank you to James Smallcombe and Adam Garnsworthy for their consistent support and guidance throughout this project. I consider myself to be uniquely fortunate in having been able to learn from their approaches to physics research. \newline

\noindent The entire GRSI collaboration at TRIUMF has contributed, in ways small and large, to my learning and development while a co-op student, and then on this work. I thank them for providing me with an immensely positive first impression of a scientific research collaboration.
